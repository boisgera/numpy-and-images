Pedagogy / logistics / framework:

  - More important things FIRST, details later, optional.

  - Check/flag objective of each track? (broadcasting, etc.)

  - Split notebooks? And link them? Very long notebooks suck.
    Notebook splitting requires "resetuping" everything;
    that may be an opportunity to summarize what should be known so far (?)

  - How to make exercises ? With answers ? Think of it.

  - Use Jupyterbook ? The (graphic) design sucks ... Ah, it has a "live code"
    mode ! How does that work ?

  - Make my own (hackish) demo of self-hosted web book with executable
    components with Pyodide? Nah. But have a look at JupyterLite ?

    advanced indexing for example and matching. Go greyscale ?

TODO:

  - "Approximate color matching". Then perceptual distance ?

Color specific:
